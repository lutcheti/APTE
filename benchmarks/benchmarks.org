* Results from benchmarks

** Methodology
We summarize here the results from benchmarks on various versions of APTE.

*** Software
We test three versions:
  1. ref: which is the official apte version c03.2beta (corresponding to the tag
     v0.3.2beta);
  2. comp: where the first step (i.e. compression step) has been implemented in
     a naive way (+170l). This corresponds to the branch optim-compression
     (commit a9fc0bb).
  3. Red: where the second step (i.e. reduction step) has been additionally
     implemented. This corresponds to the branch optim-c+r (commit d43ec64).

The version of OCaml we used is 3.12.1.

*** Hardware
 - OS: Linux sume 3.10-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.10.5-1 (2013-08-07) x86_64
   GNU/Linux
 - CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5650  @ 2.67GHz / stepping: 2 / microcode: 0x13 /
   cpu MHz: 2659.937 /cache size: 12288 KB
 - RAM: 47GO

*** Test cases
All protocols we test can be found in the folder Example (at the root of the
repo). They all have the prefix "Simple_".
A few are hand-made protocols, the others are used in practice.
The script launch_benchmark.py in this folder launch the different versions
of apte on the different protocols (note that you have to build three binaries,
one by version). We count the built-in measure of the time consumed.

** Results

The column size contains the number of basic process / number
of actions / max depth of the basic processes.
We count the time consumed in seconds and the number of final
tests (FT) (only when the quivalence is true) corresponding
to the number of symbolic nodes that are explored.

About the names of protocols:
  - Simple parallels: Simple_bench_size in Example/. The protocol is made of
    similar basic processes of the form IN.[x=ok].OUT;
  - Complex parallels: tests_h_* in Example/. Similar but here the test is much
    more complex;
  - We test two versions of the Basic Access Control Protocol (Bas. Ac. Ctrl.)
    (and check the unlikability of the passeport. The two equivalences are false.

Notes: problem with Basic Acess Control (not simple?), problem with the version Comp
(cherry-pick some commits from c+r, todo).
